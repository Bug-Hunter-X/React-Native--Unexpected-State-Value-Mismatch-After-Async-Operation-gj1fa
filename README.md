This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in React Native applications involving the `useState` hook and asynchronous operations.  The issue arises when an asynchronous action attempts to update the component's state after the component has already unmounted.  This often leads to an error indicating a state value mismatch. The solution provided uses the `useEffect` hook with a cleanup function to prevent state updates after unmounting.
